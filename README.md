# GifTastic

The goal of this assignment is to improve our effectiveness with APIs and JavaScript. We had to create an app with some buttons that returned API results. There were some default buttons on page load but the user could create more for more results. The API we worked with was Giphy and the results consisted of Gifs. There was some JavaScript involved with populating the page when the button was pressed and being able to pause/play the gif depending on the status of the gif at the time of click.

Technologies used included: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, APIs

Welcome to GifTastic! This page has a few popular gifs to choose from by default at the top of the page. If you want more gifs, simply add one in the search field, and click submit to add a new button to click!
